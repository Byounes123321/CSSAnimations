                    <h2>Learn About Space!</h2>
                    <p>A long time ago in a galaxy far far away... It is a dark time for the
                        Rebellion. Although the Death
                        Star has been destroyed,
                        Imperial troops have driven the
                        Rebel forces from their hidden
                        base and pursued them across
                        the galaxy.

                        Evading the dreaded Imperial
                        Starfleet, a group of freedom
                        fighters led by Luke Skywalker
                        has established a new secret
                        base on the remote ice world
                        of Hoth.

                        The evil lord Darth Vader,
                        obsessed with finding young
                        Skywalker, has dispatched
                        thousands of remote probes into
                        the far reaches of space....
                        It is a period of civil war.
                        Rebel spaceships, striking
                        from a hidden base, have won
                        their first victory against
                        the evil Galactic Empire.

                        During the battle, Rebel
                        spies managed to steal secret
                        plans to the Empire's
                        ultimate weapon, the DEATH
                        STAR, an armored space
                        station with enough power to
                        destroy an entire planet.

                        Pursued by the Empire's
                        sinister agents, Princess
                        Leia races home aboard her
                        starship, custodian of the
                        stolen plans that can save
                        her people and restore
                        freedom to the galaxy....
                        Luke Skywalker has returned to
                        his home planet of Tatooine in
                        an attempt to rescue his
                        friend Han Solo from the
                        clutches of the vile gangster
                        Jabba the Hutt.

                        Little does Luke know that the
                        GALACTIC EMPIRE has secretly
                        begun construction on a new
                        armored space station even
                        more powerful than the first
                        dreaded Death Star.

                        When completed, this ultimate
                        weapon will spell certain doom
                        for the small band of rebels
                        struggling to restore freedom
                        to the galaxy...
                        Luke Skywalker has vanished.
                        In his absence, the sinister
                        FIRST ORDER has risen from
                        the ashes of the Empire
                        and will not rest until
                        Skywalker, the last Jedi,
                        has been destroyed.

                        With the support of the
                        REPUBLIC, General Leia Organa
                        leads a brave RESISTANCE.
                        She is desperate to find her
                        brother Luke and gain his
                        help in restoring peace
                        and justice to the galaxy.

                        Leia has sent her most daring
                        pilot on a secret mission
                        to Jakku, where an old ally
                        has discovered a clue to
                        Luke's whereabouts....
                        The FIRST ORDER reigns.
                        Having decimated the peaceful
                        Republic, Supreme Leader Snoke
                        now deploys his merciless
                        legions to seize military
                        control of the galaxy.

                        Only General Leia Organa's
                        band of RESISTANCE fighters
                        stand against the rising
                        tyranny, certain that Jedi
                        Master Luke Skywalker will
                        return and restore a spark of
                        hope to the fight.

                        But the Resistance has been
                        exposed. As the First Order
                        speeds toward the rebel base,
                        the brave heroes mount a
                        desperate escape....
                        The dead speak! The galaxy has
                        heard a mysterious broadcast,
                        a threat of REVENGE in the
                        sinister voice of the late
                        EMPEROR PALPATINE.

                        GENERAL LEIA ORGANA
                        dispatches secret agents to
                        gather intelligence, while REY,
                        the last hope of the Jedi, trains
                        for battle against the diabolical
                        FIRST ORDER.

                        Meanwhile, Supreme Leader
                        KYLO REN rages in search
                        of the phantom Emperor,
                        determined to destroy any
                        threat to his power....
                        There is unrest in the Galactic Senate. Several thousand solar systems have declared their
                        intentions to leave the Republic. This separatist movement, under the leadership of the
                        mysterious Count Dooku, has made it difficult for the limited number of Jedi Knights to maintain
                        peace and order in the galaxy. Senator Amidala, the former Queen of Naboo, is returning to the
                        Galactic Senate to vote on the critical issue of creating an ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC to assist the
                        overwhelmed Jediâ€¦.
